# Switches
The keyboard is compatible with Kailh chocolate PG1350 v1 low profile switches only. It is not compatible with Cherry MX switches, or chocolate v2 switches.
## Hot Swapping
The Kailh Chocolate hot swap sockets only support 100 insertion/removal cycles. Please only swap switches when you are sure you want to use those switches for an extended period and do not swap them out on a daily basis as the contacts in the hot swap sockets may wear out.
