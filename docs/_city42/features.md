## Cirque Trackpad

> Please note that this is a basic pointing device. **Multi-touch gestures are not supported**
The 40mm Cirque trackpad is for ocassional, basic pointing and clicking operations. It is not intended as a replacement for a full-size, multi-touch touchpad. The default firmware supports pointing, left clicking by tapping the main trackpad area, and right clicking by tapping the upper right edge of the trackpad. The trackpad supports other operating modes and features. However, all trackpad features must be enabled and configured by [building custom firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_pointing_device?id=cirque-trackpad).
