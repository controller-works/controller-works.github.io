# Cleaning
Under normal usage the keyboard exterior should be cleaned with a damp cloth.

Very bad spills or contamination can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. The entire keyboard can be cleaned using an ultrasonic cleaner and de-ionized water or isopropyl alcohol. However, the keyboard should be allowed to dry thoroughly for several hours before attempting to power it on again.

Care should be taken not to remove the PCB from the case unless absolutely necessary. Do not apply pressure to the hot swap sockets, or LEDs as these are very delicate components. The PCB mounts to the back plate using m2 scews, while the top and bottom plates are connected using m3 screws.
