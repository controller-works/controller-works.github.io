# Hardware Modifications
**The city42 does not support user hardware modifications beyond the external components listed below.** This is a highly integrated design that is not intended for modification by the DIY keyboard builder. There are no expansion or modification points on the board, and there is no room in the case for additional components. The components on the main board are SMD (very small and closely spaced), and are soldered using lead-free solder with a very high melting point that is not compatible with leaded solder. It is not suitable for hand soldering by a hobbyist without damaging the components. The hardware design files will not be shared for any reason. If the keyboard is damaged it will need to be serviced by Controller Works with shipping costs decided on a case-by-case basis.

# Supported Modifications
* Kailh Chocolate v1 (PG1350) switches
* Kailh Chocolate v1 key caps of dimension 17.5mm x 16.5mm or smaller
* USB-C data cables
