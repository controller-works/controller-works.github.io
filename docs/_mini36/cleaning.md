# Cleaning
Under normal usage the keyboard exterior should be cleaned with a damp cloth. The OLED screen should be cleaned *very gently* with cotton swabs soaked in isopropyl alcohol (anhydrous isopropyl alcohol works best). The same can be done with other parts of the keyboard.

Very bad spills or contamination can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. The entire keyboard can be cleaned using an ultrasonic cleaner and de-ionized water or isopropyl alcohol. However, the keyboard should be allowed to dry thoroughly for several hours before attempting to power it on again.

Care should be taken not to remove the PCB from the case unless absolutely necessary. Do not apply pressure to the hot swap sockets, OLED screen, or LEDs as these are very delicate components. The PCB is press fit into the case. When inserting or removing the main board from the case pressure must only be applied to the PCB itself using a firm non-scratching object like a rubber coated tool handle. The board should be angled so the USB and TRRS connectors, and the RST and BOOT buttons are lined up with the case openings before the main PCB is pushed into place. Be careful not to catch any of the components on the edge of the metal case. There should be a 0.9mm gap between the top plate and the main pcb.  The back plate is held in place with m2 screws.
